# **CERTAINTY IS IMPOSSIBLE**

**Certainty**, for all intents and purposes, is **impossible**. In fact, we can’t even be certain about the fact that certainty is impossible. 

But if certainty is possible, it seems very clear that finding it through all these various handicaps that we have—our senses and our feeble human brains—it is impossible

**[[Quotes#^62113e| “Doubt is an unpleasant condition, but certainty is absurd. - Voltaire”]]**

You don’t know anything for certain. You may think that you know things for certain, but you don’t. You may have a very strong belief about something, and that belief may be backed up by very, very strong evidence that constantly supports it, and that could be constantly reinforced by your experience and the world that you live in, and you still don’t know that thing for certain.

So, if we don’t know anything for certain, what does all of this mean? You know, what are the implications of this if that is true? Well, here it is: 

To believe in anything, to claim to know anything, no matter the amount of empirical data or reasoning that’s at your disposal, is a leap of faith.

###  **TO BELIEVE IN ANYTHING IS A LEAP OF FAITH**

Even something as imminently in front of us at all times, like the physical world, with a seemingly endless amount of evidence that we could pull from to reinforce its existence.

### Because everything is a leap of faith at some level, Does it  make all leaps of faith equal or all beliefs the exact same thing. ?

# **WE CAN  BELIEVE IN ANYTHING WE WANT**

we can believe literally anything that we want to believe.Consider that we can believe anything, and what it means is that "what you believe has absolutely nothing to do with how **\`TRUE\`** it is."
Some people believe in something because it's convenient for them and some people believe in other things because they think that it is **TRUE**.

We think that people only believe in things, because they think it is the **truth**. There’s no other reason why people believe things.
But there are millions of people that hold **\`mutually exclusive beliefs\`** about things where it’s impossible for both of them to be correct about them.

Consider the fact that some people believe in ghosts :

- Some people believe in ghost because from the childhood they have been constantly listening to the stories about ghost.So when they’re told about demons existing or about a ghost haunting ,the idea of that happening is not that outside of what they’ve been told is acceptable to believe. So they just believe it.
- if you told these same people that there were goblins sitting up in the trees constantly watching them, they would never believe you. But in reality, goblins and ghosts are equally as unfounded and ridiculous
-  Some people vehemently believe in ghosts, some people vehemently don’t believe in ghosts. They can’t both be right. The two viewpoints directly contradict each other. One of them, or neither of them, has to be right—they can’t both be right.

someone believing in something has nothing to do with how true it is.
And it’s funny because if you asked a hundred people why they believe the things they do, 99 out of that hundred people would say that they 
believe things because it’s the truth. You know, maybe complete certainty about things is impossible, but what I believe is the closest facsimile of
truth possible. We all believe the things that we believe because we think\` it’s the closest thing to truth that we’ve come across so far.\`

If you press those 99 out of a hundred people hard enough, what you’re inevitably going to find is that they believe in things for a lot of reasons,
and not many of them have anything to do with the truth necessarily.There are so many ways that people distort reality to try to convince themselves that something is true. People believe things because they’re convenient to believe in. People believe things because it’s useful to them
on a personal level.

**CERTAINTY IS IMPOSSIBLE, AND THERE ARE ABSOLUTELY NO LIMITS TO WHAT YOU CAN BELIEVE.**

	If you’re a person who claims that the basis for why you believe the things you do is because you think they are true and not because they serve some useful purpose to you, then you are instantly assuming a lifelong responsibility—a lifelong responsibility of putting your beliefs under a microscope, a lifelong responsibility of looking at them through an extremely critical lens, of taking every new piece of information you get and weighing your current beliefs against it.

Think of the implications of that : 

	Think of now what is impossible for you to say. “It doesn’t matter what anyone says to me, it doesn’t matter which
	new facts are presented to me, I will never falter from this belief." if truth is truly the goal that you’re going for.

**POINT IS TO BE TRUE TO YOURSELF.**

- If you belief something out of convenience it's okay, point is to be true to yourself.
- If you believe something to seek truth , then you commit to a life long  process of weighing your beliefs up against the truth—it’s going to be a long, rigorous uphill battle because there are far more ways for you to be wrong about what you believe in than to be right about what you believe in.

IF CERTAINTY IS ALL BUT IMPOSSIBLE AND WE CAN BELIEVE LITERALLY ANYTHING WE WANT TO BELIEVE, IF WE ACTUALLY WANT OUR BELIEFS
TO BE **AS CLOSE TO THE TRUTH** AS POSSIBLE, WE HAVE A LIFELONG RESPONSIBILITY TO LOOK AT OUR BELIEFS UNDER A MICROSCOPE

[[Quotes#^ad4969|“Humans by nature desire to know.” -Aristotle]]
	One of the most depressing things you can ever hear is that you have reached your full potential in something—and just think of how sad that is,
	you know? That no matter how hard you work or you try from this point onward, you will never be any better than you are at this moment right now. People commonly say that it’s depressing to think about not having certainty or not knowing exactly why all of this is here or what our purpose is, but in that same way, in keeping with our example from before, Voltaire and Locke would have said, “How sad is it to hear that we’ve found the absolute truth about anything—that everything else you ever say on this matter is going to be repeating some earlier point or is going to be commentary on something that we already know? Isn’t that just as depressing?”


**Voltaire and Locke** were not willing to concede the speculation just because they were desperate to know things, you know? They weren’t willing to create these vast metaphysical explanations of the universe that really have no basis other than flawed human reasoning just so that they can say
that they know things.

Voltaire and Locke took a different approach. They wanted to look at how things actually interact with each other in a measurable way rather than
creating some story to explain all the holes that we haven’t filled in yet.
