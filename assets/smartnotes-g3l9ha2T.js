- everybody writes to remember , a \`idea\` , \`thought\` , \`quote\` or \`insight\`
- Writing is not what follows learning or studying, it is the \`medium\` of all this work

# Importance of note-taking

---

- Blank screen/Blank Sheet
- failing to understand that improving the organization of all writing make difference
- a pool of writing is easier to organize with modern tools
- these pool of note helps in writing , generating ideas or fun.

Writing doesn't start with a blank page.If you have nothing to write, panic is justified. Writing relies on good note-taking, since getting ideas from your head onto paper is the challenging part.

# IQ , Self-discipline and Self-Control , Environment

---

- High IQ (cannot change)
- Self discipline and self-control ( with will power )
- Environment ( no need of will power )

IQ is something I cannot change ,  I am in control of self-discipline and self-control with little bit of willpower. But  I or anyone else does not have this kind of control over ourselves. Self-discipline or self-control is not that easy to achieve with willpower alone.

“Willpower is, as far as we know today,a limited resource that depletes quickly and is also not that much up for improvement over the long term.”

We know today that self-control and self-discipline have much more to do with our \`environment\` than with \`ourselves\`.

Nobody needs willpower not to eat a chocolate bar when there isn’t one around.

And nobody needs willpower to do something they wanted to do anyway. Every task that is interesting, meaningful and well-defined will be done, because there is no conflict between long-and short-term interests. Having a \`meaningful\` and well-defined task beats \`willpower\` every time. Not having willpower, but not having to use willpower indicates that you set yourself up for success.

This is where the organisation of writing and note-taking comes into play.

# Structure and Plan

|      Structure provides a framework without dictating every step.<br>       |              Plans are seen as external structures imposed on the process.              |
| Structure allows for adjustments based on new insights and discoveries.<br> | Plans create a rigid path, making it difficult to adapt to new information or insights. |
|     Structure enables insights and new ideas to drive the workflow.<br>     |   Adhering to a plan requires constant effort and willpower, leading to demotivation.   |
|            Structure promotes an organic, evolving process.<br>             |                         Unsuitability for Open-Ended Processes                          |

# Slip-box

The slip-box note-taking technique, also known as the Zettelkasten method, is a powerful system for organizing and connecting knowledge. It's designed to facilitate thinking, learning, and writing by creating a network of interconnected notes. Slip-box is simple. Developed by Luhmann.

Slip-box is \`bottom-up approach\` , unlike other systems which are top up approach.

- Always have something at hand to write with to capture every idea that pops into your mind.
- Make notes of thing you read, don't just copy,use your own words of things you don't want to forget or things you might use in your own thinking or writing.
- Make \`permanent\` notes using the temporary notes made . use clear , full sentences and references for \`permanent\` notes.
- Add \`permanent\` notes to \`slip-box\`
  - add \`permanent \`notes behind related notes.
  - add links to related notes
  - should be able to easily find this note later.
- \`develop\` you topics , research or hierarchy from **\`bottom up\`.**
- write about topic you have developed.

## Tools needed

- something to write.
- a management system ( digital or manual)
- The slip-box( digital or paper)

# Critical Mass

The biggest advantage compared to a top-down storage system organised by topic is that the slip-box becomes more and more valuable the more it grows.It can only play out its strengths when we aim for a **\`critical mass\`**, which depends not only on the number of notes, but also their quality and the way they are handled.

To achieve a **\`critical mass\`**, it is crucial to distinguish clearly between three types of notes:

1. **Fleeting notes**, which are only reminders of information,will end up in the trash within a day or two.

2. **Permanent notes**, which will never be thrown away and contain the necessary information in a permanently understandable way. Stored in the slip-box.

3. **Project notes**, which are only relevant to one particular project. They are kept within a project-specific folder and can be discarded.

# Get the Gist

The ability to distinguish relevant from less relevant information is another skill that can only be learned by doing.As we read more with pen and paper and write permanent notes , we develop the ability to find patterns and get the \`Gist\` out of information easily.

But this dynamic can only start if we deliberately decide to read and being \`selective\` about it. we use our own \`judgement\` to decide what is important and what is not to read.

“Nonage (immaturity) is the inability to use one’s own understanding without another’s guidance. This nonage is self-imposed if its cause lies not in lack of understanding but in indecision and lack of courage to use one’s own mind without another’s guidance. Dare to know! (Sapere aude.) ‘Have the courage to use your own understanding,’ is therefore the motto of the Enlightenment.”
