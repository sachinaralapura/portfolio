# **Agency and Intelligence**

---
`Agency`, as a personality trait, refers to an individual's capacity to take initiative, make decisions, and exert control over their actions and environment. It’s about being proactive rather than reactive—someone with high agency doesn’t just let life happen to them; they shape it. Think of it as a blend of self-efficacy, determination, and a sense of ownership over one’s path.

People with strong agency tend to set goals and pursue them with confidence, even in the face of obstacles. They’re the type to say, “I’ll figure it out,” and then actually do it. On the flip side, someone low in agency might feel more like a passenger in their own life, waiting for external forces—like luck, other people, or circumstances—to dictate what happens next. 

It’s not quite the same as assertiveness or ambition, though it can overlap. Agency is quieter, more internal—it’s the belief that you *can* act, paired with the will to follow through. Psychologists often tie it to concepts like locus of control: high-agency folks lean toward an internal locus, feeling they steer their fate, while low-agency folks might lean external, seeing life as something that happens *to* them.

**Intelligence: The Shiny Car That Doesn’t Move**

Imagine `intelligence` as this tricked-out, turbo-charged sports car. It’s sleek, it’s got a V12 engine, and everyone’s ooh-ing and ahh-ing over how much horsepower it’s packing. Problem is, it’s just sitting there in the driveway, looking pretty. Without someone to hop in and drive it, all that power’s just… potential. It’s a flex, sure, but it’s not getting you anywhere.

That’s intelligence in a nutshell. It’s the raw brainpower—the ability to solve equations, recite Shakespeare, or figure out why your Wi-Fi keeps crapping out. Impressive? Totally. Useful on its own? Eh, not so much. It’s like having a superpower but no idea how to use it.

**Agency: The Driver Who Actually Goes Places**

Now, `agency`—that’s the driver. It’s the one who slides into the seat, cranks the ignition, and says, “Let’s see where this thing can take us.” Agency is the guts, the hustle, the “I’m not waiting for permission” energy that takes all that shiny intelligence and puts it to work. It’s the difference between knowing how to code and actually building an app. Between acing a history test and using those lessons to not screw up your life.

Here’s the kicker: you don’t even need a fancy car to get somewhere with agency. A beat-up jalopy with a determined driver will still outrun a Ferrari with nobody behind the wheel. Ever met someone who’s not the sharpest tool in the shed but somehow runs circles around everyone else? That’s agency doing its thing—quietly kicking ass while intelligence is busy polishing its trophy case.

## Why We’re Obsessed over Intelligence

So why do we drool over intelligence like it’s the secret to life? Blame society. From the minute you’re born, it’s all about how “smart” you are. Parents brag about your first words, schools drown you in grades, and job interviews grill you on how many brain cells you’ve got rattling around up there. We’ve turned intelligence into this sacred metric, like if you’re not a walking Google, you’re doomed.
But here’s the dirty little secret: being smart doesn’t mean squat if you don’t do anything with it. How many geniuses do you know who are stuck in neutral—brilliant, but broke, bored, or just binge-watching Netflix while their potential gathers dust? Meanwhile, the people out there making waves—starting companies, fixing problems, chasing dreams—they’re not always the brainiest. They’re just the ones who showed up and started driving.
It’s like we’ve been tricked into worshipping the engine and ignoring the driver. And honestly, it’s kind of dumb when you think about it.

**Agency: The Superpower You Didn’t Know You Could Build**

Agency isn’t some mystical gift bestowed upon the chosen few. It’s not like intelligence, where you’re kinda stuck with what you’ve got . Agency is a muscle. You can flex it, grow it, turn it into a freaking beast if you want to.
